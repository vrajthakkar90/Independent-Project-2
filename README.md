# Independent-Project-2
This is the repo for IP-2. I am still working on the code files as they are not optimal but these versions are quite readable is what I feel. Vectorization and efficient computing remains which I am working on. You might have to wait for sometime to get the results. The two algorithms are laplacian mesh editing and as rigid as possible surface modelling.
